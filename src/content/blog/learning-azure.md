description: My short reflection on starting to learning Azure
---

I recently started learning Azure, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the experience so far.

I was initially a bit intimidated by Azure. I had never used it before, preferring instead to use AWS or Heroku to learn about cloud. Afterall, Azure is a massive platform with a lot to offer and a lot of configurations being offered, and it can be difficult to know where to start. However, I found that the Microsoft documentation, along with the ACloudGuru subscription, to be easy to follow and comprehensive. I also found that there are a lot of great resources available online, such as the ones by John Savill.

I have been learning Azure at my own pace, and I have been focusing on the areas that are most relevant to pass AZ-900. I have already learned a lot, and I am confident that I will be able to use it well, to deploy my first application (which, hopefully, would be my capstone project).

Here are some of the things I have learned so far:

- Azure has so many services. I expressed to my mentor, Ruchi, about feeling afraid that I may never achieve technical proficiency in all of Azure. She reassured that even though she's worked in the cloud space for years now, she still struggles keeping up with all the new technologies being released every development cycle. That it would be impossible to learn everything, and that I should pace myself in learning it.
- Azure Storage offers different types of storage options catered to different needs. For example, if I wanted to store product catalog images, I might want to choose a hot tier, that provides for fast access and delivery over the Internet. But if all I wanted was to store backups that I need to access only once a year, I might choose a cold tier over a hot one, which is a lot more cost-effective.
- There are many ways to deploy an application on Azure and there is no one right way of doing it. For example, I could deploy a Node.js application using App Azure Service or Azure Kubernetes Services, depending on my needs and technical expertise. For someone who's just started to explore, Azure App Service, would in my view, be the easiest way to deploy an App, as Azure takes care of all that happens behind the scenes for me and I do not need to have concern myself about the infrastructure level configurations.

I am still in the early stages of learning Azure, but I am excited about the possibilities. I believe that Azure is a powerful platform that can help me to build and deploy applications that are more scalable, reliable, and secure.
