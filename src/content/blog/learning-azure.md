description: My short reflection on starting to learning Azure
---

I recently started learning Azure, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the experience so far.

I was initially a bit intimidated by Azure. I had never used it before, preferring instead to use AWS or Heroku to learn about cloud. Afterall, Azure is a massive platform with a lot to offer and a lot of configurations being offered, and it can be difficult to know where to start. However, I found that the Microsoft documentation, along with the ACloudGuru subscription, to be easy to follow and comprehensive. I also found that there are a lot of great resources available online, such as the ones by John Savill.

I have been learning Azure at my own pace, and I have been focusing on the areas that are most relevant to pass the Microsoft AZ-900 exam. I have already learned a lot my first week of learning Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, and I am confident that I will be able to use Azure to deploy my first application (which, hopefully, would be my capstone project).

Here are some of the things I have learned so far:

- Azure has a wide range of services, which can be overwhelming at first, as I had shared with my mentor, Ruchi. However, she said sit's important to remember that I don't need to learn everything about Azure right away. Just focus on the services that are relevant to my immediate needs.
- Azure Storage offers different types of storage options, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. It's important to choose the right storage option for your needs. If I access the data only once a year (e.g. backups of files), then, I could choose a cold tier over a hot one, which is more cost-effective.
- There are many ways to deploy an application on Azure. For example, I could deploy a Node.js application using Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service. The best way will depend on my specific needs and expertise.

I am still in the early stages of learning Azure, but I am excited about the possibilities.
