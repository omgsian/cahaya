# Background

HopePad is a wall in which users can write messages of encouragement for each other. Over a week long period, I experimented with Flask, a Python web framework, to create this application.

# Tech Stack

- Flask (Python framework)
- HTML5/CSS3
- Tailwind
- MySQL
- JavaScript

# Architectural Decisions

To be written.

# Challenges

Flask was a new web framework that I've never used before and so it took awhile to understand. Fortunately for me, as I've been exposed to other web frameworks, like React.js or Angular.js, navigating the project structure of a typical Flask Application - and understanding why it's structered that way - wasn't all that difficult as there were more similaries than there were differences.
