# Background

My Scratchpad is a Flask application designed for users to leave behind messages of encouragement for each other. Over a period of a week, I referenced an online tutorial, and created a scratchpad application, that is secured with HTTPS, and has login mechanisms to prevent unauthorised users to leave spam messages.

# Tech Stack

- Flask (Python framework)
- HTML5/CSS3
- Tailwind
- MySQL
- JavaScript
